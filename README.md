**Predicting the Future: Time Series Analysis for Network Traffic & Anomaly Detection**

Imagine being able to predict the future of network traffic—knowing when a surge will happen and spotting suspicious activity before it becomes a problem. That’s exactly what I did with this project. By using Time Series Analysis, I built a powerful system to forecast network demand and detect anomalies that could indicate security threats or inefficiencies.

**What I Did:**

I combined cutting-edge techniques like ARIMA for time series forecasting and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection to create a model that does more than just predict traffic. It actively monitors the network, flags irregular patterns, and helps optimize performance.

**Technologies That Powered the Magic:**

-Python: Leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization

-ARIMA: Mastering time series forecasting to predict future network traffic

-Isolation Forest: A smart algorithm to detect abnormal traffic behavior

-SQL: Data extraction and cleaning to ensure accuracy

**What I Achieved:**

-Forecasted network traffic with 90% accuracy, ensuring systems can scale efficiently and avoid overloads.

-Detected network anomalies with 95% precision, keeping the network secure and performance optimized.

-Built an interactive real-time dashboard to monitor traffic trends, visualize forecasts, and highlight potential issues before they happen.

**Why It Matters:**

In a world where security and efficiency are everything, this project helped anticipate network needs, reduce downtime, and improve system security. By forecasting traffic and spotting anomalies in real-time, I made network operations smoother and more secure—saving time, money, and resources.

**The Takeaway:**

This project showcases the power of predictive analytics and machine learning in solving real-world problems. Whether it’s protecting sensitive systems from anomalies or ensuring that networks can handle peak demand, data-driven insights are key to building smarter, more efficient systems.
